A dynamic QR code generator for NFTs (non-fungible tokens) would allow users to generate a unique QR code for each NFT they own. This QR code could then be scanned by others to access information about the NFT, such as its provenance, ownership history, and other relevant details. The dynamic nature of the QR code means that this information could be updated over time, allowing for a comprehensive and up-to-date record of the NFT's history to be maintained.
