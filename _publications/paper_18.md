This project enhances industrial automation through ReACT (Reasoning and Action) AI agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with actionable execution. These agents analyze and plan industrial processes, making real-time decisions to support flexible and reconfigurable production systems. The AI agent facilitates Human-Machine Collaboration by enabling direct interaction with machines through natural language, leveraging LLM-based reasoning to analyze tasks and execute actions via OPC UA for dynamic and efficient industrial operations.
