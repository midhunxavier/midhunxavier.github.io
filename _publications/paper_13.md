A learning management system (LMS) is a web-based technology developed to improve the learning process in educational institutions. This study addresses the drawbacks of existing LMS by developing DeLMS (Decentralized Learning Management System) and aims to revolutionize the way educational institutions manage and deliver educational content using Ethereum smart contracts and the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). By leveraging Smart contracts and IPFS cutting-edge technologies, DeLMS provides a secure, transparent and decentralized platform for managing and delivering educational content. The content addressing feature of IPFS eliminates the need for constant requests to centralized servers for the location of files, resulting in faster file transfer and reduced energy consumption. The proposed system has the potential to change the way educational institutions operate, making it more accessible and beneficial for both students and educators.
