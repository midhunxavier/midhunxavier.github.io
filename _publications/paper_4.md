This paper introduces the concept of plant model generation from the recorded traces of events using the process mining technique. The event logs are obtained by visually simulating a simple distributed manufacturing system using the OPC UA communication protocol. The process discovery alpha algorithm is used to extract the process model in Petri net format. The system behavior represented in terms of Petri net is then fed to construct the ECC of the basic function block in compliance with IEC 61499 standard using the proposed notation. Finally, the formal verification of the closed-loop system is done with the help of a tool chain that consists of fb2smv converter, symbolic model checker NuSMV, and other tools for representing counter-examples.
