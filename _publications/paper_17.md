This paper introduces an innovative multiactor framework that harnesses the potential of LLMs to augment the functionalities of ICS. By integrating conversational AI technologies, this framework significantly improves human-machine interactions, enabling sophisticated analysis and visualization of intricate data sets. The core of the system comprises specialized LLM actors that interact through a LangGraph-based multi-actor framework, addressing various aspects of IEC 61499 control systems including PLC code analysis, SQL query execution, and data visualization. This integration enables operators to interact with the control system using natural language, significantly reducing technical barriers and enhancing the accessibility and usability of complex industrial systems.
