This paper presents the creation of a series of function blocks with the specific aim of testing the portability of IEC 61499 applications across diverse development and runtime environments. These function blocks have been developed to cover a wide range of test scenarios, including basic data types, functions, boundary conditions, and adapter features. The function blocks can be conveniently exported or imported through the use of XML files, thus facilitating seamless testing. By testing the runtime environment of different IEC 61499 systems, these function blocks help to identify and highlight any possible issues that may arise related to portability.
