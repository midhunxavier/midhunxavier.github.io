This paper summarises recent developments in the application of modular formalisms to model-based verification of industrial automation systems. The paper is a tribute to the legacy of Professor Hans-Michael Hanisch who invented Net Condition/Event Systems (NCES) and passionately promoted the closed-loop modelling approach to modelling and analysis of automation systems. The paper surveys the related works and highlights the impact NCES has made on the current progress of modular automation systems verification.
