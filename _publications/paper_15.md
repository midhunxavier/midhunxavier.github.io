This paper presents a novel approach for tracking products and processes within industrial multi-agent control systems by leveraging blockchain technology. The suggested solution facilitates the recording and validation of every step involved in creating a tailored product through the utilization of Ethereum-based smart contracts. The OWL ontology is used to describe agents and their capabilities and these software agents interact with IEC 61499 function blocks for process execution. The software agents record process events at each stage on the blockchain and the latter smart contract helps to trace and verify these process sequences of the customised product.
