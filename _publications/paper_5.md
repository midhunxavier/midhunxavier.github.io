In this paper, we describe a method to automatically derive the controller for an automated process by an interactive learning approach using a simulation model developed in Visual Components 3D simulation software. The latter is used to record the events of the processes and the controller is generated as an IEC 61499 function block. To create different process scenarios, the actuator signals are triggered manually in appropriate order. The controller logic in Petri net is derived by process discovery algorithms with help of recorded events and conversion of Petri net to IEC 61499 function blocks is done by a software tool configured with a set of transformation rules.
