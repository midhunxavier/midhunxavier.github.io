In this paper, we discuss how process mining techniques can be applied in industrial control systems for modeling, verification, and enhancement of the cyber-physical system based on recorded data logs. Process mining is used for extracting the process models in different notations from the recorded behavioral traces of the system. The output model of the systemâ€™s behavior is mainly derived using an open-source tool called ProM. The model can be used for such applications as anomaly detection, detection of cyber-attacks and alarm analysis in industrial control systems with the help of various control flow discovery algorithms. The extracted process model can be used to verify how the event log deviates from it by replaying the log on Petri net for conformance analysis.
