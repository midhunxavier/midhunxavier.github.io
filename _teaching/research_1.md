My research interest lies in the formal modeling and verification of industrial control systems, with a particular focus on the IEC 61499 standard. I am interested in exploring novel techniques for modeling and verifying complex cyber-physical systems, including the integration of digital twin technology for formal verification purposes. I am also interested in investigating the use of process mining for analyzing and optimizing the performance of industrial control systems. Ultimately, my goal is to develop more efficient and reliable control systems that can be formally verified to ensure their safety and security.
