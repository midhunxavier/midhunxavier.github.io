My research interest lies in the development of autonomous AI agents capable of adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. I focus on designing intelligent systems that leverage reinforcement learning, knowledge-based reasoning, and real-time data processing to make informed decisions with minimal human intervention. These AI agents can be applied across various domains, including industrial automation, robotics, and smart infrastructure. By enhancing AI agents' ability to learn, generalize, and respond to changing conditions, I aim to contribute to more efficient, resilient, and scalable decision-making systems.
