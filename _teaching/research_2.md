Interested in exploring the use of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to build more secure, efficient and transparent control systems for industrial applications. This includes investigating the potential of blockchain technology for enabling secure and decentralized data sharing, as well as for automating control tasks and optimizing industrial processes. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to the development of next-generation industrial control systems that leverage blockchain technology to enhance their security, reliability, and performance.
