My research explores the integration of knowledge-based AI with large language models to enhance contextual reasoning and situational awareness. I am interested in developing AI agents that utilize ontologies, semantic graphs, and structured knowledge bases to improve their ability to understand and process complex information. By incorporating domain-specific knowledge into AI decision-making, these agents can provide more accurate and explainable recommendations in applications such as automated diagnostics, industrial process optimization, and intelligent virtual assistants. My goal is to advance AI systems that bridge the gap between human expertise and machine intelligence for more robust and interpretable solutions.
