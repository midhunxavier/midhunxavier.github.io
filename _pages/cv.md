# Work experience

- 2024- : Researcher

  - LTU, Lule√•, Sweden

  - Implemented a decentralized manufacturing marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain platform, utilizing software agents to enhance traceability and transparency in flexible production systems. This solution facilitates seamless transactions and ensures reliable tracking of products and processes, optimizing efficiency and accountability across the manufacturing supply chain.
  - Developed and deployed artificial intelligence-based observers that leverage advanced algorithms to predict failures and anticipate maintenance needs within industrial control systems. These sophisticated AI systems analyze complex data patterns and operational parameters, enabling proactive maintenance strategies and enhancing overall system reliability and efficiency.
  - Designed and implemented a decentralized learning management system (LMS) leveraging Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This system enables secure, transparent, and decentralized storage and management of educational content, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration in the learning environment while ensuring data integrity and privacy.
  - Employed methods like quantization, pruning, and model distillation to decrease the size of neural network models without compromising accuracy, enabled them to operate efficiently on edge devices.
  - Integrated a Large Language Model (LLM) with an IEC 61499 industrial control application to develop a natural language interface for human-machine interaction, maintenance, and monitoring of control systems.

- 2019-2020: Full Stack developer

  - RCKR Software Pvt Ltd, Bengaluru, India

  - Designed, developed, and deployed end-to-end machine learning solutions, including preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
  - Developed scalable and efficient full-stack applications integrating machine learning models, front-end interfaces, and back-end services using technologies such as Python, Next.Js, and MongoDB.

- 2017-2019: System Engineer

  - Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) , Kochi, India
  - Integrated machine learning models into web and mobile applications by developing RESTful APIs and deploying models using cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, ensuring scalability and reliability.
  - Designed and developed visually compelling dashboards and reports using tools like Power BI, or Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to effectively communicate data findings to stakeholders.

- 2017: Data Analyst - Research Intern
  - Uvionics Tech India Pvt Ltd
  - Designed, developed, and implemented machine learning models for disease prediction, utilizing algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and neural networks to analyze medical data and predict disease risks and outcomes.
  - Evaluated and validated machine learning models using techniques such as cross-validation, ROC curve analysis, and confusion matrix to assess model performance and optimize models through hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods to achieve robust and reliable predictions in real-world healthcare applications.
