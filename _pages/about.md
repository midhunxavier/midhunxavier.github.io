Hi, I’m Midhun Xavier, a passionate researcher and developer, currently pursuing a PhD at Luleå University of Technology, Sweden. My work primarily focuses on creating innovative solutions that merge cutting-edge technologies like Machine Learning, Blockchain, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) to solve real-world problems in industrial systems.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve had the opportunity to work on several groundbreaking projects. I implemented a decentralized manufacturing marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing traceability and transparency across the production chain. This system enables seamless transactions and reliable tracking of products, significantly improving supply chain efficiency.

I’ve also designed AI-based predictive maintenance systems, integrating advanced algorithms to anticipate equipment failures and enhance system reliability. These systems are crucial for industries that rely on predictive analytics to avoid costly downtime and improve overall performance.

Additionally, I’ve explored the potential of decentralized learning systems, developing a learning management system (LMS) using Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS. This innovative LMS ensures secure, transparent, and decentralized storage, fostering greater collaboration and data integrity in educational environments.

My technical expertise spans across a range of domains, including frontend and backend development (React, Angular, Python), machine learning, and blockchain technologies. I also have experience in formal verification and modeling of industrial control systems, particularly in applying the IEC 61499 standard for the design and verification of cyber-physical systems.

Through my research and development efforts, I aim to contribute to the creation of sustainable and energy-efficient industrial systems, focusing on adaptability to diverse operating environments and minimizing environmental impact. I also have a keen interest in integrating blockchain technology to build more secure and efficient decentralized industrial control systems.

Feel free to explore my projects and publications to learn more about my work, or reach out to me if you'd like to collaborate or discuss new ideas!
