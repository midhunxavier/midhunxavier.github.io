Hello! My name is Midhun Xavier and I am a versatile engineer and researcher with experience in various fields such as Full Stack development, System Engineering, Data Analytics, Robotics, and Blockchain technology.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from MG University in 2014 and went on to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from NIT Trichy, which I completed in 2017. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Formal Modelling and Verification of IEC 61499 Systems from LTU, Sweden, which is expected to be completed in 2025.

In my work experience, I have had the opportunity to work on various interesting projects. As a Full Stack developer at RCKR Software Pvt Ltd, I worked on implementing an "Identity Provider Platform" feature and building a health monitoring and recording web application with a configurable content management system. I also worked on transforming FHIR to CHbase Data Integration platform and vice versa to transfer health records between two different platforms.

During my time as a System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), I developed an "EMAIL STATS BOT" tool and integrated a "Status Monitor Web application" with a chatbot using the RASA framework. I also deployed an "Encrypted QR Code Generator and Verification Application" to prevent counterfeit products from the retail industry using Blockchain technology.

As a Data Analyst - Research Intern at Uvionics Tech India Pvt Ltd, I developed a real-time streaming model to analyze and visualize ECG signals and investigated a Disease Prediction Model using clustering and classification techniques.

Apart from my work experience, I have published several research papers in various journals. My research interests include Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Formal Verification, Process Mining in Industrial Control Systems, Digital Twin, and IEC 61499 standard.

I have a strong technical background and possess skills in Python, React, SQL, SparQL, Unix, Git, Docker, Django, AWS, solidity, Ethereum smart contract, Web 3, IPFS, Blockchain, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing.

In summary, I am an enthusiastic and driven engineer with a passion for research and a proven track record in developing innovative solutions to complex problems.
