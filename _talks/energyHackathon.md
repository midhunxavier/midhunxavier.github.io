Decentralized energy systems are an emerging trend in the energy sector, where small-scale energy generation units such as solar panels, wind turbines, and fuel cells are installed in homes and buildings, providing clean energy to the users. These systems have the potential to revolutionize the way we generate and consume energy, making it more sustainable and affordable. In the future, decentralized energy systems could be integrated with smart grids, allowing for more efficient and reliable energy distribution. As a result, they could play a crucial role in the ongoing energy transition towards a more sustainable future.
